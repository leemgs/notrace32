# TITLE
NoTrace32: Tracepoints based debugger for debugging ARM/Linux binary on Android

# Members
Geunsik Lim, Andrein Ahn

# Motivation
Many people use H/W Trace32 in the Linux development environment.
Actually, this equipment is used for debugging a real mobile phone based
on Android platform.

# Issue
But, Trace32 is not software solution.
This means that we need expensive costs to purchase Trace32.

# Goal
The main purpose of this project is to produce purely a software tracing tool
like Trace32 (http://www.trace32.com/) by analyzing Linux binary on run-time.
Finally, we will evaluate our output on ARM based real devices.

# Required knowledge
DWARF, ELF, Linkers & Loaders, Tracepoint, and so on.
